# **WikiPills**


This project was presented in **Smart India Hackathon 2020** under **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** (Problem statement: [AN319](http://awssih2020.com/)).

Our team, **H4CK3RS**, secured the **first prize ðŸ¥‡** amongst a participating pool of 5,00,000+ students and ended up scoring the highest points amongst all finalists under the organization Amazon Web Services (AWS).

# Idea Brief


**WikiPills** is an integrated software platform for monitoring and enhancing the healthcare of kids, senior citizens and the specially-abled. This platform focuses on 3 areas of healthcare - Monitoring, Assistance, and Analysis.


WikiPills uses novel geofencing techniques to monitor patients and maintains their Electronic Health Records (EHR) to keep a track of their health metrics (like daily medicinal intake, medical case history, BPM, SpO2 levels, etc.). Futhermore, a virtual assistant (Alexa skill) and a voicebot (IVR-based assistant built on Twilio) are provided for easier accessibility. A vuforia-based augmented reality module is also available to help end-users easily check their daily drug dosage limits at a glance. All the patient-specific data from the platform is collected (with user's consent) and shown in the form of meaningful analytics on the web dashboard. A machine learning model is also fed the same data with relevant parameters to predict the possibility of Chronic Heart Diseases (CHD).
